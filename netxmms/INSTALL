Until I autotools-ify this, compile like so:
$ gcc src/*.c -o netxmms -laudacious `pkg-config audacious --cflags`

Replace `audacious' with whatever (xmms or whatever), audacious is just the
newest so I give the above example.

I would not suggest installing it to /usr/bin or whatnot until I add autotools
stuff.
