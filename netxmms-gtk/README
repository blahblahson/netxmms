netxmms-gtk-1.0.0


netxmms-gtk is a client to compliment the netxmms [www.digital-haze.net]
server. Currently, it has the following features:
    * Forward/Next
    * Pause
    * Play
    * Stop
    * Volume control

Usage is simple:
$ netxmms <ip address> [port]
Where <ip address> is the location of the computer running the server (and
hence XMMS/XMMS fork). [port] designates the port which the server is running
on, and is optional (it defaults to 42561).

Notes:
    * I hardly ever write things for Windows, but I figured I should make the
      source for this compatible. It should compile with windows as far as I
      have tested, but some of the functionality may be impeded due to little
      experience with win32 development and Windows' lack of POSIX compliance.
      It's not tested very much on Windows either, but it seemed to work fine.
    * Another note regarding Windows is how it shuts down sockets. netxmms
      reports a 'connection refused' error when netxmms-gtk terminates on
      Windows. This could be to my limited knowledge of how winsock functions,
      or just bad programming on Microsoft's part. Either way it should close
      the socket cleanly instead.
    * Volume control is implemented, but 1.0.0 does not fetch the volume on
      startup and starts at 77. This is partly due to laziness, and partly for
      consistency since netxmms (presently, at 1.0.0) can not respond to
      changes in volume at the moment (see the netxmms-1.0.0 README for
      detail).
