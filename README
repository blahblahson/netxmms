netxmms-1.0.0


netxmms is a server which allows you to remotely control any XMMS
[www.xmms.org] based media player (this includes Beep Media Player
[www.beep-media-player.org] and Audacious [www.audacious-media-player.org].
Possibly some other forks, too).

netxmms is complimented by clients which (should) run on other machines over a
network, normally over a LAN (although any network connection is fine). netxmms
(1.0.0) provides the following functionality to clients:
    * Forward/Next
    * Pause
    * Play
    * Stop
    * Volume control
All clients and versions of netxmms are (or at least should be) backwards
compatible. That is, any client will work with any server (as of this version,
the server does not send any information and only receives it; this may be
subject to change but will not break compatibility should it be implemented).

Available is a GTK+ client, and a Nintendo DS client. See the respective
subdirectories and READMEs (as well as the netxmms/README for details on the
netxmms server).
